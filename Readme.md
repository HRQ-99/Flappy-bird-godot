# Flappy Bird (Godot)

Welcome to the Flappy Bird game project built using the Godot Engine! This was my first game project, so I made it to help me learn the basics.

## Introduction

This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using the Godot Engine. The goal is to navigate the bird through pipes without hitting them.

## Installation

The current way is to clone the repo, and run the game using Godot-engine. Might make a release version to make it simpler.

- Press the spacebar or arrow-Up key to make the bird flap its wings.
- Avoid the pipes to keep the bird flying.
- The game ends when the bird hits a pipe or the ground.
