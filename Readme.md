## Introduction

This project is a clone of the popular Flappy Bird game, developed using the Godot Engine. The goal is to navigate the bird through pipes without hitting them.

## Installation

The current way is to clone the repo, and run the game using Godot-engine. Will make a release version to make it simpler.

## Game Controls

- Press the spacebar to restart the level
- Press arrow-up key to make the bird flap its wings.
- Avoid the pipes to keep the bird flying.
- The game ends when the bird hits a pipe.
